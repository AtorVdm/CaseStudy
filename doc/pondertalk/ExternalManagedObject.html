<p class='object_description'>
 A managed object that represents a remote managed object. It acts as a proxy, rerouting any requests that it receives to the remote object. An external managed object is not imported and used in the normal way, it is automatically instantiated and filled in by the <use> clause when it recognises a remote address.
